## ZIO-like for Scala 3

This project is an experimentation project to explore the possibilities for a scala 3 optimized API for ZIO.

This project is not meant to be used in any way and will stop existing when the ZIO core team decides to target scala 3 for a major ZIO release, at that point all the discoveries made here will be donated to the core team of ZIO to be used as they see fit, with the hope of providing a good basis to start.

### Usage

This is a normal sbt project. You can compile code with `sbt compile`, run it with `sbt run`, and `sbt console` will start a Scala 3 REPL.
